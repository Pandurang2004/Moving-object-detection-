# Moving-object-detection-
In this project, I leveraged the power of OpenCV, a versatile computer vision library, to detect moving objects in a video stream using the Haar Cascade algorithm. By implementing this efficient technique, I enabled the system to identify and track moving objects in real-time, enhancing applications like security surveillance and traffic monitoring.
